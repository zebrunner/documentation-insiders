# Test sessions

On the very first login to Zebrunner, you will be asked to select one of the two screen modes: **Integration via agent (Tests)** or **Selenium Hub (Sessions).** This view will be displayed by default when you open the **Test runs/Test sessions** page.

If you skip this step, **Integration via agent (Tests)** will be enabled by default. You can switch between the 2 modes by using the control on the **Test runs/Test sessions** page.

![Test Runs and Test Sessions](https://github.com/zebrunner/documentation/blob/master/docs/assets/images/test_runs_and_sessions.png?raw=true)

The **Test sessions** page allows you to view the list of test sessions executed recently and see detailed information about the testing process.

To access the **Test sessions page,** go to the side menu and click **"Test runs/Test sessions"** (![Test Sessions Page](https://github.com/zebrunner/documentation/blob/master/docs/assets/images/test_runs_icon.png?raw=true) icon on the side menu). If the **Test sessions mode** is not set by default, click on the **“Tests/Sessions”** switch in the upper-right corner of the window.

All the actions with test sessions are performed on this page.

## View test session info
On the **Test sessions** page, for every item you can see:

* Test and build name
* Test session status
* Environment

At the top of the popup, in the **"Access URL"** field, generate a new access token clicking ![Generate Access Token](https://github.com/zebrunner/documentation/blob/master/docs/assets/images/icon_generate_access_key.png?raw=true) and copy it by clicking ![Generate Access Token](https://github.com/zebrunner/documentation/blob/master/docs/assets/images/icon_copy_access_key.png?raw=true).
4. In the area below, generate the capabilities required to run tests in your language (switch between Java, C#, Go, Ruby, Python, PHP, Webdriver.io).
5. Select the platform (Android/Web), application, browser name and version, video resolution.
