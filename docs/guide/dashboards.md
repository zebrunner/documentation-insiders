# Dashboards

Dashboard in Zebrunner is a special page that displays widgets with main analytical info on your test results.

A system **General** dashboard is displayed when you open Zebrunner (or press ![Zebrunner](https://github.com/zebrunner/documentation/blob/master/docs/assets/images/zebrunner_icon.png?raw=true) in the upper-left corner of the window). General is not editable – you cannot change its name, make it hidden, delete it or add widgets.

In addition to General, you can create other dashboards to systemize widgets according to your needs.

**Optional:** If you have **“Modify widgets”** and **“Modify dashboards”** permissions, you can edit a dashboard by applying a certain parameter to all the widgets on a dashboard (instead of setting it for each widget manually).

For example, you want to see your test results on a dashboard for the API platform only.

For this, perform the following steps:

1. After the **“Edit Dashboard”** popup appears, enter the parameter **“PLATFORM”** (in uppercase) to the **“Key”** field and **“api”** (in lowercase) to the **“Value”** field.
2. Click **“Add”** and **“Save”**.
3. Refresh the page.

The dashboard will be displayed with updates.

**Note:** You can apply several parameters (keys) to a dashboard. But you can add only 1 value to a parameter.

## Hidden dashboards
Dashboards in Zebrunner can be visible or hidden.

Hidden dashboards are useful when:

* You need to test and adjust experimental widgets to a dashboard;
* You want to track your automation team performance on a special dashboard;
* You’d like to hide a dashboard from other users.

**Note:** You need the **“View hidden dashboards”** permission to make a dashboard hidden. Otherwise, you will not see this option.

To make a dashboard hidden, open **“New dashboard”** or **“Edit dashboard”** popup and turn on the switch **“Hidden”**.
